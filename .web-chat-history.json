    "content": "Perfect! I've fixed the mobile view layout with the following key changes:\n\n## Mobile Layout Fixes:\n\n1. **Fixed viewport sizing**: Added `position: fixed` and `width: 100%` to body to prevent mobile browser scroll issues\n\n2. **Pinned header**: Made `.chat-header` position fixed at the top (below status bar) with proper z-index\n\n3. **Pinned footer**: Made `.input-area` position fixed at the bottom with proper z-index  \n\n4. **Proper content area**: Made `.chat-area` position fixed with calculated top/bottom positions to fit between header and footer\n\n5. **Full viewport usage**: Used fixed positioning throughout to ensure the layout fills the entire viewport (100vh/100dvh)\n\n6. **Responsive adjustments**: Added specific height adjustments for smaller screens (480px breakpoint)\n\nThe mobile view now has:\n- ✅ Status bar pinned at top\n- ✅ Chat header pinned below status bar  \n- ✅ Input area (footer) pinned at bottom\n- ✅ Chat content area properly sized between header and footer\n- ✅ No viewport scrolling issues\n- ✅ Proper z-index layering for sidebar overlay\n\nThe layout will now properly size to the viewport and keep the header and footer pinned in their positions on mobile devices.",
